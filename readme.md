## Project Description

This is the new website for my company, Rebellious Pine LLC, a general contracting firm in New Hampshire, USA.
I was disapointed with the old site that was built using wordpress and decided to brush off my HTML skills and
build one myslef. I took a free template from learning-zone/website-templates on github, definitly check out his
repo as it gave me a lot of inspiration and a much needed framework since calling my js skills rudimentary would
overly generous. I doubt anyone will ever read this but if you do, hello! please feel free to use and copy my work
as I have used and built off of others. -Weltbuerger
